# memphis-jam

This is an early prototype for the game Memphis Jam. The game involves multiple players working together to solve a puzzle. Each player will have one button. Each player's button shifts a combination of circles through 3 states making them bigger or smaller. The group of players have to work together to make all of the circles match the target sizes.
