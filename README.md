# memphis-jam

This is a prototype for the game Memphis Jam. The game involves multiple players working together to solve a puzzle. Each player will have one button to interact with meaning it is fast to pick up and play. Each player's button shifts a combination of circles through 3 states making them bigger or smaller. The group of players have to work together to make all of the circles match the target sizes.

Below is an example of a 3 person level. The large white circles have to be matched to the size of the red outline to complete the level. A single player input will control the size of one, two or three of the circles.  Two or more players inputs may control the same circle, so coordination is needed.

Here is an example of a 4 person level.

Here is the target end state.

Currently the prototype is built as a mobile game, but can be quickly ported to a multiplayer desktop game. Custom controls would be built with hope that six or more players can play simultaneously.

As the difficulty progresses the game will ask the current team to invite people around them to join and increase the team size. New players would have easy onboarding with their button being assigned to only control one circle. We hope that this game can quickly bring strangers together in a shared goal and that throughout the rest of the exhibition they feel able to chat and play together.

How to play the prototype (mobile web version)
On the mobile version of the game, instead of individual buttons for each player, the white circles now also act as inputs. Click the white circles through their states to get all of the white circles equal to the red outline.

Beware! Currently there is no transition through levels and they load instantly when solved. Each background is repeated twice with slightly more difficult the second time round. If you are not careful it might load the next level without you noticing!
